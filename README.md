# TODO: 

- [X] The homepage should be filled with  information about the market volatility and how it affects the stock market.
- [ ] Provide some information about the current stock market and how it actually is going up despite what the media says. Talk about the importance of how to read charts, not just believe in chart junk. 
- [ ] Talk about investments, retirement, or other financial decisions. 
- [ ] Some ideas to get you  started include educating individuals on future returns, the impact on retirement funding, and  the impact of other volatility factors (federal funds interest rate, inflation, etc.). 
- [ ] Inflation and companies willingness to take risks could also be graphed in some way if we can find the data.
